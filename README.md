# TherNet: Thermal Segmentation Network Harnessing Physical Properties

## News
- **[23/8/2024]** The code of TherNetV1 has been all released, TI-Cityscapes is coming soon!!
- **[9/8/2025]** TherNet: Thermal Segmentation Network Harnessing Physical Properties has been accepted by TPAMI2025!!!


## Installation

This project is built upon the [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) framework. We sincerely thank the OpenMMLab team for their remarkable work.

**Important Note:**
This project is based on a **legacy version** of `mmsegmentation`. To ensure proper functionality and reproducibility, we strongly recommend that you **use the code provided in this repository directly** instead of installing the latest version of `mmsegmentation` from its official source.

If you wish to integrate our methods into a newer version of `mmsegmentation`, you may need to manually migrate the core components of our project (e.g., models, data processing pipelines) to adapt to the API changes in the new framework.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mzzcdf/TherNetV1.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Conda environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda create -n TherNetV1 python=3.6 -y
    conda activate TherNetV1
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # First, install PyTorch. Please adjust the command according to your CUDA version.

    # Install other requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
